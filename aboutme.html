<p><font face="lucida calligraphy" size="4">Before anything else, let me introduce myself. It's Sarah Aina Binti Ahamad Zahidi here.Living in Sungai Buloh, Selangor, I am 21 years old. On August 3, 2002, at 7:17 p.m., I was born in the Hospital Bersalin in Kuala Lumpur. I'm now pursuing a diploma in information management at UiTM Kedah. While I was studying, I also resided outside of UiTM Kedah in Taman Lembah Bujang Fasa 3. </p></font>

<p style="text-align:center"><font face="lucida calligraphy" size="4">I just completed the MBTI assessment in every detail. The results confirmed my suspicions that I am an ISTP. I am not a firm individualist despite being an ISTP.I'm usually on my own when it comes to meeting my basic necessities and providing for myself. My parents are the ones I go to for guidance and support at this time. I, too, am usually timid and inhibited. When I speak, it's usually to myself. In addition to being timid because I am self-conscious about letting others see the real me, I am also uncomfortable with the spotlight. My closest friends and family, however, are an exception to these rules. I might be a little reserved at first, but after I get to know someone as well as you get to know me, I'm an outstanding girl. I have a hard time making friends, but once I do, we have an incredible time together since we are all so unique. I receive as much as I give in terms of laughs, jokes, and comedy from the people around me. Depending on the group of people I remain close to, my personality tends to switch from being reserved and humorous. Spending time alone is a great way to refuel after spending time with others, which is why I value it so much. One of the most significant things that helps me have more energy the following day is my time alone.

<p style="text-align:center"><font face="lucida calligraphy" size="4">I've also started working as an assistant at a school uniform store while I wait to enroll at the UiTM. After completing my SPM, I decided to have a job so that I could give myself new challenges and grow in self-assurance. When I have to speak in front of a crowd, I become anxious and my hands start shaking. My heart rate rises as well at times. The reason behind this is that I usually freeze up when there are a lot of people in front of me. As someone who naturally prefers quiet, I find this quite draining. I've gained some self-assurance in talking to strangers at work, but I'm still anxious about public speaking. In the future, I'd want to be confident enough to give presentations in front of large audiences.</p></font>
